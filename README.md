# ðŸŽ¬ Hangman Game â€“ Movie/Show Edition (Java Console App)

Welcome to a simple Hangman Game built in Java, where one player enters the name of a movie or TV show, and the others try to guess itâ€”letter by letterâ€”before the hangman drawing is complete!

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- **Player 1** inputs a movie/show name.
- All **vowels (A, E, I, O, U)** are revealed to start with.
- Other players get **7 chances** to guess the remaining letters.
- Each incorrect guess adds a part to the hangman drawing.
- The game ends when:
  - The players guess all the letters correctly, OR
  - The full hangman figure is drawn.
